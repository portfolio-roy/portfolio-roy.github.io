# Portfolio Website Project
### Mobile design (First milestone)

> This is the first milestone of the portfolio website project. This is not an actual mobile website. It's just a mobile-like mock-up based on the figma design we were provided. The project will grow to an actual portfolio website someday. 

> One thing I want to share about CSS. Back in 2017, I was learning flex-box for the first time. Then I tried to build my own lightweight CSS framework based on flex-box. That project helped me a lot. I used many helper classes from that stylesheet here. That piece of code is open source, anyone can use that. I named it "Flexy Framework". The link is given below.

### Desktop design
